        <h1>Kayla Harwell's Portfolio</h1>
        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
          Hi! My name is Kayla Harwell. I am a rising junior from Howard
          University. I am 19 years old and I am from Buffalo, NY. I didn't plan
          on majoring in CS until I was a junior in high school. Before then I
          had my sights set on being an oncologist, but after a few medical
          internships I realized that wasn't for me and shifted my focus towards
          technology,something that I'd always had a love for.
        </p>

        <p>
          At Howard I like to spend my time involved on campus through clubs
          like <a href=" https://nsbe.org/home.aspx"> NSBE </a> and holding
          E-board positions in<a href="https://www.acm.org/"> ACM</a> and
          <a href="https://swe.org/"> SWE </a> .I love Howard and its culture.
          Everyone there is unique and I wouldn't be where I am today without
          them. Along with this opportunity Howard has opened many doors for me
          to grow and learn.
        </p>

        <h2>What Projects Have I Worked On?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li id="list">
            "Absent Future" - This project is my most recent. It is a first
            person shooter game about the horrors of a future affected by global
            warming. This was made my friends and I during an Amazon Games
            hackathon using Lumberyard, Amazon's game engine. My specific role
            was the back end developer, I was responsible for making the
            computer generated AI enemies run towards the player and if one
            touched the player, one life would be lost. We ended up winning the
            grand prize with this project. This was the first hackathon we ever
            won, so this project is near and dear to my heart.

              Here's an article about it!</a

          <li id="list">
            "Naturally U"- This project is something I'm proud of because it's
            all about natural hair, something that I love about myself and know
            a lot about. Naturally U is an all-in-one resource for natural
            hair.It shows you affordable hair products for your hair type, style
            tutorials, and the closest barbers or hair stylists to the user.
            Naturally U was made during the UNCF CS Summer Academy where I
            worked with a team on 3 to complete this project using HTML,CSS,and
            Python.My specific role was the full stack developer. I worked on
            the front end of several pages of the app including the home page
            and the tutorial selection page and on the back end of the login
            page. At the end of the summer pitch competition our project took
            the grand prize!<a

              Here's an article about the program! </a
            >Fun fact : I'm not in the first picture because I decided that was
            the right time to go to the bathroom and when I came outside they
            were done taking the picture :)
          </li>

          <li id="list">
            "Little Green Foot"- This project is a sort of environmental effect
            tracker. In this app you could mark "environmentally friendly"
            actions you did that day such as carpooling to work, recycling, etc.
            and you would earn points from those actions which the user could
            cash out those points in the form of gift cards and other prizes. My
            role on this project was the full stack developer. I worked with the
            front end developer to create all the visuals for the mock up and I
            worked with the backend developer to create the point system
            algorithm.

          My number 2 would be Jamaica! Its so beautiful and I've never been to
          a place with a tropical climate before so it would be a first but if I

        <p>Another good question! Well since you asked...</p>

        <ul>
          <li id="list">
            I love Brockhampton. Honestly anything by them is good but if your
            just getting into them I would recommend the Saturation 3 album.
            Pure gold!
          </li>

          <li id="list">
            Same thing goes for SZA but right now I have CTRL on repeat while I
            wait for her to drop something new. Will she do it...I'm not sure :(
          </li>

          <li id="list">
            For some one off songs that Im enjoying now I would say "Caught Up"
            by Majid Jordan, "What Kinda Music" by Tom Misch, and "Target On My
            Chest" by Brent Faiyaz are all good.
          </li>

          <li id="list">
            At the end of the day I get all of my music from the "Pollen"
            playlist on Spotify so I'd check there too.
          </li>
        </ul>
