      <h1>Kayla Harwell's Portfolio</h1>
      <h2> Who am I? </h2>
        <p> Hi! My name is Kayla Harwell. I am a rising junior from
            Howard Univerity. I am 19 years old and I am from Buffalo, NY. I didn't plan on
             majoring in CS until I was a junior in HS. Before then I had my sights set on being
            an oncologist, but after a few medical internships I realized that wasn't for me and
            shifted my focus towards technology,something that I'd always had a love for.</p>
        <p> At Howard I like to spend my time involved on campus through clubs like NSBE
            and holding E-board positions in ACM and SWE.I love Howard and its culture.
            Everyone there is unique and I would'nt be where I am today without them. Along with this
            oppertunity Howard has opened many doors for me to grow and learn.</p>
