      <h1>Kayla Harwell's Portfolio</h1>
      <h2> Who am I? </h2>
        <p> Hi! My name is Kayla Harwell. I am a rising junior from
            Howard Univerity. I am 19 years old and I am from Buffalo, NY. I didn't plan on
             majoring in CS until I was a junior in HS. Before then I had my sights set on being
            an oncologist, but after a few medical internships I realized that wasn't for me and
            shifted my focus towards technology,something that I'd always had a love for.</p>


        <p> At Howard I like to spend my time involved on campus through clubs like NSBE
            and holding E-board positions in ACM and SWE.I love Howard and its culture.
            Everyone there is unique and I would'nt be where I am today without them. Along with this
            oppertunity Howard has opened many doors for me to grow and learn.</p>
      

      <h2> What Projects Have I Worked On? </h2>
        <ul>
            <li> "Absent Future" - This project is my most recent. It is a first person shooter game
                 about the horrors of a future affected by global warming. This was made my friends
                 and I during an Amazon Games hackathon using Lumberyard, Amazon's game engine.
                 My specific role was the back end developer, I was responsible for making the
                 computer generated AI enemies run towards the player and if one touched the player,
                 one life would be lost. We ended up winning the grand prize with this project.
                 This was the first hackathon we ever won, so this project is near and dear to my
                 heart. </li>

            <li> "Naturally U"- This project is something I'm proud of because it's all about natural hair,
                  something that I love about myself and know a lot about. Naturally U is a all-in-one resource for 
                  natural hair.It shows you affordable hair products for your hair type, style tutorials, and 
                  the closest barbers or hair stylists to the user. Naturally U was made during the UNCF CS Summer
                  Academy where I worked with a team on 3 to complete this project using HTML,CSS,and Python.My specific role was the full 
                  stack developer. I worked on the front end of several pages of the app including the home page and the tutorial selection
                  page and on the back end of the login page. At the end of the summer pitch
                  competition our project took the grand prize!</li>

            <li> "Little Green Foot"- This project is a sort of environmental effect tracker. In this app
                  you could mark "environmentally friendly" actions you did that day such as carpooling to work, recycling, etc.
                  and you would earn points from those actions which the user could cash out those points in the
                  form of gift cards and other prizes. My role on this project was the full stack developer. I worked 
                  with the front end developer to create all the visuals for the mock up and I worked with the backend developer
                  to create the point system algorithm.</l1>
